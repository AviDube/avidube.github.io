## Information

Hello! I'm Avi Dube, a Computer Engineering student at Purdue University passionate about pushing the boundaries of Control Systems, Machine Learning, and Automation. I thrive at the intersection of innovation and practical problem-solving, which led me to found SWARM - a cloud-based simulation platform now used by MIT Lincoln Laboratory and other research institutions.

As the Lead Researcher of Drone SWARMS at Purdue University under Professor Sundaram, I'm working on breaking edge technology using simulations to test control systems and integrating neural networks and reinforcement learning. My expertise spans across C++, Python, MatLab, and C, with practical experience implementing PID, Motion Profiling, Odometry, and RRT control algorithms in drones and robots.

From developing AI vision systems at SAAB to leading cross-functional research teams, I'm driven by making complex autonomous systems more accessible and reliable. When I'm not coding or tinkering with robots, you'll find me playing basketball, modifying cars, or enjoying time with friends.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
