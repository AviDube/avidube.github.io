# The Goal

Create a server that is an intuitive and secure platform tailored to make buying and selling tickets as straightforward as possible while keeping pricing as low as possible so users don't have to pay exorbitant fees.

# How we approached the problem

## User-Centered Design

From our experience using the old discord server that got shut down, we determined user pain points and crafted solutions that directly addressed these challenges. Features like a ticket-selling marketplace were added to streamline previously cumbersome processes.

## Automation for Efficiency

We developed and implemented custom Discord bot commands to automate tasks like verification, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free user onboarding process.

## Focus on Security

User safety was a priority at every step. The server has an automated verification system that requires users to confirm their Purdue student status, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining a trusted environment.

## Aesthetics and Structure

From channel organization to server branding, I emphasized clarity and visual appeal to enhance the user experience.

# Key Features of the Server

Ticket Marketplace: A centralized hub for users to buy and sell tickets securely and efficiently.
Custom Bots: Intelligent automation to handle verification and other key functions.
Secure Access: Robust measures to ensure privacy and trust.

# Results

The server has seen rapid growth in user engagement with over 600 active members and multiple ticket transactions. Users have praised the platform for its ease of use and security features, and we continue to receive positive feedback on the server's design and functionality. Our goal is to expand the server's reach and provide an even more seamless experience for Purdue students looking to buy and sell tickets.
